# IDC and Circular Reference Financial Model

This repository contains a financial model built in Excel demonstrating **Interest During Construction (IDC)** calculation and how to handle **circular references** in project financial modeling.  


---


##  Key Features
- **IDC Calculation**  
  - Uses a Gantt chart to map construction timelines.  
  - Calculates interest during construction and capitalizes it into project cost.  
- **Project Cost Build-up**  
  - Adds IDC back to the base project cost to arrive at the total project cost.  
- **Circular Reference Fixes**  
  - **Method 1:** Iterative calculation in Excel.  
  - **Method 2:** VBA macro to resolve circularity in a controlled way.

##  File Structure
- `IDC & Circular Reference Financial Model.xlsm` → Main Excel model.  
- `IDC and Circular Reference Case Overview.pdf` → Documentation with explanation of IDC, project cost, and circular reference. 
- `README.md` → This file.
 
---

##  How to Use
1. Open the Excel file and enable macros.  
2. Explore the excel file to see how project costs are built.  
3. Check the **two circular reference fix sheets** to compare the methods.  
4. Read the `IDC and Circular Reference Case Overview.pdf` for conceptual background.

##  Requirements
- Microsoft Excel (with macros enabled)

---

## Objective
This model demonstrates how I, as a financial modeler, would approach IDC and how I would fix circularity in the financial model.
